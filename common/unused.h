/* gcc's __attribute__((unused)) only works for C and not C++. So we

** A bad way is
**
** #define DNETC_UNUSED_PARAM(x) (x = x)       - bad!
**
** because it will break on C++ references and call the = operator
** on classes which might have undesired side-effects. Better is
**
** #define DNETC_UNUSED_PARAM(x) {if (&x) {}}
**
** but might not get optimised away by the compiler. Third there's
** an unassigned rvalue like
**
** #define DNETC_UNUSED_PARAM ((void)x)
**
** which might still cause senselessness warnings on some compilers
** though. We choose the last option for now. */
