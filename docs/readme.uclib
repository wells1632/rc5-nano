Additional information for Linux/uClibc clients.
================================================

Beginning with v2.9007-489 we use a new build style using 
static uClibc instead of glibc.

This client does not need the 'host' command.
We hope, this will fix the various resolver problems which occured in the 
past with incompatible libc/glibc library versions.
