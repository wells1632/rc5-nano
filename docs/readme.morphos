 1.0  System requirements --------------------------------------------

     - MorphOS 0.4 or greater (MUI4 is required for the GUI part).
     - PowerPC 603e or greater.
     - Altivec cores require CPU with AltiVec and MorphOS 2.0 or newer.
     - A TCP/IP stack (MorphOS built-in one will do just fine)

 2.0  Getting started ------------------------------------------------

    To install the client, drag the client's drawer to a location of your
    choice and fire it up.  If you would like the client to be started
    automatically each time your boot, click the "Add to WBStartup" icon
    or run the client from a shell using the '-install' option - this
    will install an icon to your WBStartup drawer, which will run the
    client from where you actually placed the client's drawer (DO NOT copy
    the client into your WBStartup drawer).

    If you have never run the client before, it will initiate the
    menu-driven configuration. Save and quit when done, the
    configuration file will be saved in the same directory as the
    client. Then, simply restart the client. From that point on it will
    use the saved configuration.

    The configuration options are fairly self-explanatory and can be run
    at any time by starting the client with the '-config' option or
    selecting 'Configure' in the GUI's menus.  A list of command line
    options is available by starting the client with '-help'.

    A detailed guide to the various configuration options is available
    online at http://faq.distributed.net/

 3.0  Notes ----------------------------------------------------------

    If you want to contribute to the Team MorphOS, you can join the team
    from address:
    http://stats.distributed.net/team/tmsummary.php?project_id=27&team=32053

    If you want to contribute to the Distributed Amiga effort, visit the
    effort home page at http://distributed.amiga.org/.

    IMPORTANT: By defaut the work is unattributed.  Configure the email
    address in the General Client Options to get the work attributed to
    you.

    By default the client is configured to pause if the system is running
    on battery power.  The client is also paused while charging the battery
    to avoid straining it unnecessarily.  The client can be configured to
    ignore the battery status if so desired.

  3.1  Setting the time zone -----------------------------------------

    The client always displays the current time in UTC - not your local
    time!  For this to work correctly, you need to ensure your timezone
    is set correctly.  This can be done through the System Settings Locale
    page.

  3.2  Packets and work units?

    If you are upgrading from the old 2.710x clients, you may not be
    familiar with the new terminology that has replaced "blocks".  The
    new clients refer to "packets" and "work units".  Descriptions of
    their meanings can be found at
    http://faq.distributed.net/cache/138.html

  3.3  Dial-up detection caveats

    If you choose to enable the dial-up detection feature of the client,
    please be aware that you will not be able to exit your TCP/IP stack
    software until the "Detected IP-link drop" message has been shown by
    the client (which happens within 5 seconds of going offline).  If
    you try to exit before that, the client will still be using
    bsdsocket.library, and your TCP/IP software will most likely complain.

    Also note that if you want to make use of the "automatic go online"
    feature (dials your ISP automatically when the client runs out of
    work), you will need to be using Genesis. This feature is not
    supported for other TCP/IP stack software.

 4.0  GUI for MorphOS client -----------------------------------------

    The client built-in GUI is enabled when running the client from
    Ambient (e.g. by double-clicking its' icon).  If starting the client
    from the Shell, the client will run in console mode.  In GUI mode,
    the console output will be shown in the GUI, and the client may be
    controlled by the menus.

    MorphOS client can also use the classic AmigaOS client GUI
    library, if preferred.  You need to install ClassAct/ReAction if
    you wish to use it.  To use it, replace the included
    dnetcgui.library with a library from the Classic AmigaOS client
    release.

  4.1  Preferences and options ---------------------------------------

    The GUI may be configured to your liking by using the MUI
    settings.  To edit choose "Project/MUI settings..." from menu.
    To configure the listview, select "Lists". Additionally, the
    following tooltype can be used in the client's icon:

    HIDE

      Specify this tooltype to cause the client to not open a window on
      startup, and show an icon and/or tools menu item (defaults to
      both, but may be changed in the preferences) on the desktop
      instead.

  4.2  ARexx commands

    It is possible to control the clients with ARexx, via the DNETC.1
    port.  The following commands are available:

    QUIT    - Shutdown the client and exit
    HIDE    - Iconify/hide the GUI
    SHOW    - Uniconify/show the GUII
    PAUSE   - Pause the client
    UNPAUSE - Unpause the client
    UPDATE  - Flush the client buffers and fetch new packets
    FETCH   - Fetch new packets for the client
    FLUSH   - Flush the client buffers
    RESTART - Restart the clients
    CLEAR   - Clear the console window
