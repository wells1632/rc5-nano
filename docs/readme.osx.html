<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The first step is to download the client and unpack the archive. Presumably, if you
  are reading this, you have done so. Once that is complete, you may place the dnetc
  folder anywhere you wish on the hard drive.</p> 
<p>This client is a command line client. To run it, you will need to open a Terminal
  window using Terminal.app. Navigate to the dnetc folder (you can do this by typing
  "cd" and then dragging the dnetc folder to the Terminal window, and hitting Return).</p>
<p>Once there, you can start the client's configuration by typing:<br>
  <code>./dnetc -config</code></p>
<p>The "./" indicates that you are running a command from the current directory. 
  The "<code>-config</code>" is a switch which tells dnetc to start configuration 
  mode. It will do this automatically if you have never configured it before, 
  but using the switch will always start config mode.</p>
<p>You will be introduced to a text-driven menu with fairly self-explanatory options. 
  Primarily, you will need to enter your email address as your distributed.net ID.
  Other options can usually remain unchanged, and can be modified later by starting
  dnetc with the <code>-config</code> switch.</p>
<p>When you are finished, save and quit from the menu system. The client will exit. To
  begin processing, type:<br>
  <code>./dnetc</code></p>
<p>You can then hide Terminal, minimize the window to the Dock, or just leave 
  it there. You can see other command line options for the client by starting 
  it with the <code>-help</code> switch.</p>  
<p>Additional guides to the various configuration options are available online.

<a name="quiet"></a>
<h2>Running the client in quiet mode</h2>
<p>It may be desirable to run the client in the background; that is, to close the
  Terminal window that it is running in, but have it continue processing. There are two
  ways of doing this: either by default, or temporarily.</p>
<p>1. To always run in quiet mode, first stop any running clients:<br>
  <code>./dnetc -shutdown</code></p>
<p>Then open the configuration menu:<br>
  <code>./dnetc -config</code></p>
<p>Select the General Client Options menu, and choose the option labeled:<br>
  <code>Run detached/disable all screen output (quiet mode)</code></p>
<p>Enable this option. Note that if you are running the client in quiet mode, you may
  wish to enable logging, so that you can check dnetc's activity. You may enable this from
  the main menu under Logging Options. When you are finished, save and quit.</p>
<p>Finally start the client using the command:<br>
  <code>./dnetc</code></p>
<p>This will start the now-silent client into the background. You may then close
  Terminal if you wish.</p>
<p>2. To run in quiet mode just once, first stop any running clients:<br>
  <code>./dnetc -shutdown</code></p>
<p>Then start the client again with the following switch:<br>
  <code>./dnetc -quiet</code></p>
<p>This will start the now-silent client into the background. You may then close 
  Terminal if you wish. Similarly, if you have configured the client to always 
  run quiet as above, you can prevent it from doing so with the <code>-noquiet</code> 
  switch.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions on Mac OS X</h2>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the changes in this version of the client ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Check the CHANGES.txt document included in this distribution.</p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a GUI version of the client ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Any GUI features not included in this client will be 
  released as portable, open source add-on utilities. However, since distributed.net 
  is a volunteer organization, we rely on users to contribute code. Please 
  contact us if you're interested. See also
  <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php">http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php</a></p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I check if a silent (quiet mode) client is running ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Open a Terminal window and type: <code>ps -acwx | grep 
  dnetc</code>. If you see any processes named dnetc then it is running. Alternatively, 
  you can check your logfile to see if it is being updated. (You might type 
  <code>tail &lt;logfile&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;logfile&gt;</code> is 
  the name of your log file.)</p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I quit the client if it is running ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Just type: <code>./dnetc -shutdown</code> The client 
  will report how many clients were found and stopped. If it fails, you can 
  always use the "kill" command to stop it.</p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I setup the client that it starts up automatically 
    when I boot up my computer ?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Use the <code>-install</code> switch on dnetc. You may
    be prompted for your password (note that you must be a member of the 'admin'
    group in order to do this). The client will then install a so called Startup
    Item in /Library/StartupItems. If you later move the client to another folder,
    you will have to <code>-install</code> the client again.<br>
    Once done, make sure the client has been configured (<code>./dnetc -config</code>)
    and that your distributed.net ID is properly defined. You might also want
    to enable logging (option 4) and activate an automatic restart when the
    configuration file is changed (option 1, then 6).<br>
    You can also <code>-uninstall</code> the client at a later date.
    </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client and XYZ simultaneously, but 
  XYZ destroys my crunch rate. What can I do ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Probably not much. Most of the problems that are suited 
  to distributed computing are heavily CPU-intensive. Remember, dnetc is intended 
  to only use up idle time on your computer. Ideally, your use of the computer 
  should not be affected by its presence. This is why it is set to a very 
  low priority by default. If you want to experiment with higher 
    priority settings, use these steps to change the priority:<br>
<ul>
      <li><code>./dnetc -shutdown</code></li>
      <li><code>./dnetc -config</code></li>
  <li>Performance related options</li>
  <li>Priority level (make your changes here)</li>
  <li>Save and quit</li>
      <li><code>./dnetc</code></li>
</ul>
  But be warned ! This may slow down other applications, including the Finder.</p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> The client seems to slow down my application XYZ. What 
    can I do ?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Open the configuration menu (<code>./dnetc -config</code>) 
    and go to General Client Options. Select "Pause if running". Type in the name 
    of your application (e.g. XYZ, as shown by <code>ps -acwx</code>) and then exit
    the client. This will cause the client to pause if it detects that application
    is running. Make sure you don't leave it open all the time, or dnetc will never
    run<br>
    You can also pause and restart the client from the command line by typing
    <code>./dnetc -pause</code> and <code>./dnetc -unpause</code/>, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I want to run the client as a screen saver. How do 
  I do this ?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> You can use the third-party tool Agfun to do
this. It is available on the <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/addon.php">Add-Ons page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I share my client's buffers with other (non-Mac OS) 
  clients ? ["sharing" is simultaneous access via file-sharing, but also manual 
  transfer of the buffer files from one machine to another]<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> In general, this is not recommended. However, you can 
  use the <code>-import</code> switch to accomplish this task. See the <code>-help</code>
  for more info.<br>
  If you need to share buffers between many clients, you may wish to consider 
  setting up a personal proxy. For more info on perproxies, visit
  <a href="http://www.distributed.net/download/proxies.php">http://www.distributed.net/download/proxies.php</a></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I completely remove the client from my system ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> If you used the <code>-install</code> switch to run the
  client each time you boot up your machine, use the <code>-uninstall</code>
  switch to remove the startup item. Then, quit any running instances of the 
  client (<code>./dnetc -shutdown</code>), and then simply delete the folder
  containing the client.</p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> My computer runs too hot. What can I do ?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Recent Macs contain hardware temperature sensors, which dnetc can
  use for temperature monitoring. To activate it, open the configuration menu
  (<code>./dnetc -config</code>) and go to General Client Options. Select the option
  labeled: <code>Pause if processor temperature thresholds are exceeded</code>. Say yes to
  activate the monitoring, and a new option will appear for defining the temperature
  thresholds. Please note this function relies upon dedicated hardware (either the Thermal
  Assist Unit embedded into some PowerPC processors, or machine-specific sensors). As
  such, it may or may not work as expected.<br>
  If the monitoring is enabled, clients in version 2.9008.491 or better will
  display the current CPU temperature upon startup to help you determine the
  temperature thresholds. If no sensor can be found, a message will tell you
  this feature is not available.</p>
