This is a port of the dnetc client to the Netware LibC platform.

Requirements:

  - Netware 5.1 or higher, with the latest support pack.  Note
that I have not tested on Netware 5.1, but I assume that if you have 
the latest libc.nlm on Netware 5.1, it should work the same.  My
development and testing was all done with Netware 6.5, with the latest
support pack.  Any feedback on earlier versions would be appreciated.

  - The Netware TCPIP stack must be properly configured to do DNS lookups, 
meaning you must be able to "ping www.distributed.net" at the console and get
responses back.

Running:
  Extract the zip file into a directory on the server, and "load <path>/dnetc"
at the console.  Then follow the regular steps for configuring and running 
the client as you would on any other platform.  To stop running, do "unload
dnetc" at the console.  If your system does not already have libgcc_s.nlm
in sys:\system, you will need to put the version included with this client
there yourself (or in another directory on your search path).  I would recommend 
using the libgcc_s.nlm that Novell supplies with your Netware version versus
using the one included here whenever possible.
  

 
Notes:

  - Netware is not a preemptive OS, nor does it have thread scheduling 
priorities.  This makes it difficult for the distributed.net client to 
"play nice" with other processes.  Running it on a production server can 
hinder other processes.  I have made it yield the processor regularly as 
a start, and plan on doing more work in this area in the future. Update: 
any client after 10/19/2004 should behave better.  I have enabled the
Netware 5/6 pseudo-preemption feature on dnetc.nlm.  It's still not a 
perfect solution because even the newer newer kernel is not truly preemptive, 
but things should be somewhat better now.

  - In the past, there was a client for Netware that was compatible with NW 
3.x and 4.x.  This is not the same client, and does not have the features 
the previous Netware porter put into that client.  While I do not plan on 
reviving the old CLib-based client, if time permits, I may bring over some 
of the netware-specific features he put into that client. 

CHANGE LOG:

  - 10/20/2004:  Enabled MPK pseudo-preemption on the NLM to make it more 
friendly to other processes.
