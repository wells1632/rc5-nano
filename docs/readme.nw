 Welcome to the distributed.net client.
 This version is a unified client for both SMP and non-SMP machines.

 This document covers information specific to the client for NetWare.
 Refer to other enclosed documentation or browse the online FAQ at
 http://faq.distributed.net/ for non-platform-specific documentation.

    1.0  Getting started
    2.0  distributed.net client for NetWare specific history
    3.0  client-for-NetWare specific configuration file options
    4.0  Frequently seen problems, frequently asked questions.

 1.0  Getting started ------------------------------------------------
   
    Just copy the client into a directory of your choice and fire it up.
    If you have never run the client before, it will prompt you with a
    list of options. Quit and save when done, and then reload the client.

    I *strongly* recommend that you do NOT put the client in the search
    path when running NetWare 5 (type 'SEARCH' at the console prompt to
    see what the search paths are).
    NetWare 5.x is brain-dead with respect to how commands are entered on
    the command line. It searches for NLMs first, rather than looking at
    its built-in commands first, which effectively negates the use of the
    -pause, -unpause, -restart and -shutdown switches.

    Dependencies (or not):

    A3112.NLM: is *required* by this version of the client. 
    NetWare 3.x users who do not have this file in their SYS:/SYSTEM 
                directory may obtain it from Novell. It is part of the 
                every recent (after Oct/95) update, ie LIB311.EXE or 
                LIB312.EXE. If you can't find it, send me mail.
    NetWare 4/5 users already have this in their SYS:/SYSTEM directory.

    TCPIP.NLM: The client does not require TCPIP (ie it will run offline
    if TCPIP is not detected), but will use it if available/loaded.

    NETDB.NLM: The client does not require NETDB, but will use it if 
    available/loaded.  NetWare 3.x and NetWare 4 pre-4.10 don't come with 
    a resolver (convert hostnames to IP addresses) library out of the box, 
    so I wrote my own. If you have problems with name lookups, please get 
    NETDB.NLM (its included with every NetWare 3.x and 4.x CLIB fix pack) 
    and load it before loading the client. 

    SFTIII: The client has not been tested under SFTIII.
    NetWare 3.11: The client has not been tested under NetWare 3.11.
    Feedback to <cyp@fb14.uni-mainz.de> would be much appreciated.

 2.0  History/Notes: -------------------------------------------------

    v2.8011+: the client for NetWare no longer supports OGR. For further 
    information please refer to http://faq.distributed.net/cache/188.html

    v2.8011+: the client will attempt to use the originating namespace 
    (DOS/NFS/OS2/NT) of the ini file if one was specified on the command line, 
    or if no -ini keyword was specified, then the originating namespace of 
    the NLM itself. The "originating namespace" is the namespace of a file 
    at the time it was created/copied to your NetWare volume. I have no idea 
    if this works on NW5, so feedback would be appreciated.

    v2.8010+: the client must either be LOAD'ed from a NetWare volume, or 
    have been provided with the -ini keyword that specifies the canonical 
    path (ie, including volume and directory) to the configuration file. 
    This is because the client infers its working directory from the path 
    of the -ini, or if the -ini option wasn't specified, then the directory 
    that the client itself is in. Note that using a directory on the DOS 
    partition isn't recommended and probably won't work since many CLIB 
    functions simply do not support file I/O from DOS partitions. Putting 
    the client on a DOS partition and everything else on a NetWare volume 
    is fine.

    v2.8000+: the ability to run the client from within the polling loop 
    has been removed entirely. 

    v2.8000+: The client will shut itself down when the server is DOWN'd.

    v2.7112+: the client supports -shutdown, -restart, -pause and -unpause 
    as console commands. That is, the client inserts itself into the console 
    command parser and can be issued these commands from there. For example, 
    the _command_ (note, *not* "LOAD command") 'dnetc -pause' will cause 
    the client to pause itself. 
    Due to a bug/feature in the NetWare 5 console command handler, these 
    options will not be available if the client was initially loaded 
    without  the 'LOAD' or if the client is in the search path. 
    Use 'dnetcmd' instead.

    v2.7112+: the client supports several configuration file settings that 
    are specific to the client for NetWare. See 'NetWare specific 
    configuration options' below.

    v2.7014+: the client can also be loaded more than once. Unloading and 
    reloading the client for executing -fetch, -flush or -update is therefore 
    no longer necessary. 
    
    v2.7012+: the two SMP and non-SMP clients have been merged into one 
    unified client.

 3.0 client-for-NetWare specific configuration file options -------------

    the following configuration file setting are specific to the client 
    for NetWare and are not editable from the client's -config screens.

    [NetWare]             ; this is the name of the subsection in dnetc.ini
    squelch-util-indicators=0  [not available on NetWare 5.x]
    
    - squelch-util-indicators: (default=disabled)
      enabling this option tells the client to *attempt* to periodically 
      reset the 'processor utilization' indicator (as seen in monitor 
      for example). This option was added when users noted that 
      load-sensitive tasks such as file server backup would not run well 
      when the client was active. This was traced to what appeared as 
      'high' processor utilization which caused those jobs to reschedule 
      themselves because they believed the file server to be heavily loaded. 
      'squelch-util-indicator' is not available on NetWare 5.x.

      It is a common assumption that high 'processor utilization' is 
      an indication of a heavily loaded processor. This is *not* true.
      The 'processor utilization' indicator is simply an indication
      of how much time the OS spends in the 'idle loop' (called 'polling 
      loop' on NetWare 3) as a ratio to time spent in servicing threads.

      Note that this is option only causes the client to *attempt* 
      squelching for brain-dead applications that rely on the 'utilization
      indicator' as a base for rescheduling logic. If your aim is to "hide"
      the client from your boss because you/he/she thinks a whizzing snake
      is scary, don't use the client or get another boss. :)

 4.0  Frequently seen problems, frequently asked questions ---------------

    - Q: I get a startup message saying "Cannot find public symbol XYZ"
         Whats up with that?
      A: *sigh*  Read the section on "Getting Started".
         Please let me know if you see this on NetWare 3.11

    - Q: The client consistantly fails to find a keyserver. It says
         "Unable to resolve xyz"
      A: Either TCPIP.NLM or SYS:/ETC/RESOLV.CFG is incorrectly setup.
         - Check the TCP/IP stack by trying to ping a host on the internet.
           For example: "LOAD PING 192.233.80.4" (<-www.novell.com)
         - If your RESOLV.CFG is properly configured, then you will also
           be able to ping by name. For example: "LOAD PING www.novell.com"
         Note that RESOLV.CFG does not have a second "E", and that it has
         a .CFG suffix and not '.conf'.

    Please report problems, suggestions to the port maintainer

    a response right away.
