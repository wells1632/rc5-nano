This file contains a list of mini-projects. Submissions as well as
volunteers :) are welcome.

The list is maintained by Cyrus "cyp" Patel <cyp@fb14.uni-mainz.de>.
To avoid having the wheel reinvented, please holler if you wish
to tackle a project.

*Do not* add bug reports or platform specific to-do (which are synonymous
with 'bug' or 'feature request') here.

If you have the expertise but lack the time to handle a project,
please post your willingness to assist to coders@lists.distributed.net.
Perhaps someone else has what you don't. :)

Quick and easy:

   - add exec(logcompressor) support
   - auto-pause if non-client cpuusage exceeds a threshold,
     and remain suspended until the non-client cpuusage drops below
     another threshold

More difficult:

-- Devise and write a better filebuffer scheme.       Priority: VERY HIGH
   a) better "locking". The current method of writing 0x1 to tag
      a file as 'locked' is not ideal. Using a specific value to
      identify the lock as the client's own would probably solve
      all locking problems.
   b) contain both in and completed blocks in a single file. Even
      better would be a format that accomodates blocks from all
      projects.
   c) The buffer format must support FIFO. The current FIFO scheme
      uses a "find one more suitable than default" scheme. It works
      well and has a low overhead but is contest specific.
   d) The buffer format should allow variable record size or sufficient
      per record padding or record 'continuation' so that we can add
      fields without having to redesign the whole mess again soon.

-- Write a routine to import/export uuencoded buffers for/from users
   that can only update their buffers via mail. The functions to
   import binary buffer records already exists.           Priority: Medium

-- Add FTP as a supported buffer exchange protocol. The client could
   directly STOR buff-in.xx and requests to RETR rc5 would cause the
   keyserver to return a rc5 block from its ready queue.   Priority: Low

-- Write a small routine to obtain a list of the local host's UP af_inet
   if's by using SNMP or ... Use ioctl() to do the same (for your port).
   Linux/OS2/Win32/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/BSDOS/MacOS are already implemented.
                                                           Priority: Low

-- (remote) config via xml.

-- Split network.cpp into netio primitives and high-level/wrapper handling
   functions. Something along the lines of whats used in the proxy would
   be nice, but without the bloat please.             Priority:

-- convert the "work unit size" to something human. :)
   "cpu-work-hours" maybe?                            Priority: Medium

-- Look into the MPI (message passing interface) API for parent<->child
   process communications.                            Priority: Medium
