This benchmark suite is for x86/linux.

You have to install the following programs to use it:

1. perfctr (you need to patch your kernel for this)
       http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/

2. PCL - Performance Counter Library
       http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/PCL/ 


To benchmark the cores you first have to build the client as usually. Don't
forget to test it! (dnetc -test)
Then run make here to build a bench program for every RC5-72 core in the 
client.
Run the pclbench-* test programs to get some nice instruction/cycle count
and other performance counter figures.
